%% Description
%
% This script calculates the LIMITING COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION of a generic 
% Kinematic Coupling. 
%
% The method is explained in detail in:
% F. Patti and J. M. Vogels, "Self-alignment of kinematic couplings: Effects of deformations,"
% Precision Engineering, vol. 60, no. September, pp. 348â€“354, 2019
% doi: 10.1016/j.precisioneng.2019.08.013.
% 
% The naming convention is as much as possible similar to the one used in
% the paper.
%
% Inputs:
% Since any layout can be studied, the geometry is defined by simply assigning the
% coordinates of the 6 points of contact with the matrix "r", where each
% column "i" is the coordinates of point "i". Moreover, the matrix "n"
% contains the normals of the contacts (pointing towards the moving body).
%
% The load is defined with a number of forces with the matrix "FTot":
% colomn "i" represent the force "i", applied in the point of coordinates
% stored in the column "i" of the matrix RForce.
%
% Outputs:
% LCF calculated with the classical approach;
% LCF calculated with the approach proposed in the paper (worst case scenario 
% due to deformations); in both cases the corresponding removed 
% constraint is provided;
% Reaction forces when the coupling is in nominal position;
% Reaction forces in the equilibrium configuration that defines the LCF,
% where a certain constraint is removed and friction forces are present.
% This is done in both cases: classical approach and worst case scenario.
