This script calculates the limiting coefficient of friction (LCF) for a generic kinematic coupling.
It follows the calculations described in

F. Patti and J. M. Vogels, “Self-alignment of kinematic couplings: Effects of deformations,” Precis. Eng., vol. 60, no. September, pp. 348–354, 2019, doi: 10.1016/j.precisioneng.2019.08.013.

It receives in input the coorinates of the 6 points of contact, the 6 normals of the contacts, the forces and the points of application of such forces.
it returns the LCF following the classical approach and the LCF following the approach proposed in the mentioned paper.
